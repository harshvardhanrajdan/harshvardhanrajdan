üé≠ THE BEGINNING:

**Invocation to Sarasvati**
"May the goddess Sarasvati, who is like a stream of nectar flowing from the moon, 
who is adorned with the garland of pearls that are the words of the Vedas, 
who is seated on a white lotus, who is the embodiment of all knowledge, 
bless this work with her grace."

**The Author's Humility**
"I, Banabhatta, though unworthy, attempt to compose this biography of the great king Harsha. 
Like a dwarf trying to reach the moon, I know my limitations, but my devotion to my master 
compels me to undertake this task."

**The Purpose**
"This work is not merely a historical account, but a literary composition that combines 
the sweetness of poetry with the weight of history. It tells the story of how a young prince 
became the greatest ruler of his time."

**The Kingdom of Thanesar**

were happy, and his rule was just and benevolent."

**King Prabhakaravardhana**
"Prabhakaravardhana was a king of great wisdom and valor. He belonged to the Pushyabhuti 
dynasty, which had ruled over Thanesar for generations. He was known for his military 
prowess, his administrative skills, and his patronage of learning."

**The Royal Children**
"King Prabhakaravardhana had three children: Rajyavardhana, the eldest son and crown prince; 
Harshavardhana, the younger son; and Rajyashri, the beloved daughter. All three were 
endowed with beauty, intelligence, and noble qualities."

**Rajyavardhana - The Crown Prince**
"Rajyavardhana was the eldest son and heir apparent. From his early years, he showed 
exceptional qualities of leadership and military skill. He was trained in all the arts 
of war and governance, and was beloved by the people for his kindness and generosity."

**Harshavardhana - The Younger Prince**
"Harshavardhana, though younger, was no less talented than his brother. He was 
particularly skilled in literature and the fine arts. He had a deep understanding 
of human nature and was known for his wisdom beyond his years."

**Rajyashri - The Princess**
"Rajyashri was the youngest and most beloved child. She was beautiful as the moon, 
intelligent as Sarasvati, and virtuous as Sita(Divya). Her marriage to Grahavarman, 
king of the Maukhari dynasty, was celebrated throughout the land."
